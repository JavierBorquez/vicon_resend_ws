## Have the libmotioncapture library sending the rigidbody data with:
./vicon_sender vicon 192.168.1.39

then grab the UDP package and publish it with ROS2 with: 

source ~/vicon_resend_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 run vicon_resend vicon_resend

this will publish a odometry message to the topic /odometry
to read the stream from a new terminal do:

source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
ros2 topic echo /odometry --field pose.pose


##This will stream the pose of all rigidbodies without making any distinction between them
##To properly use it for control make sure there is only one rigidbody in the working area
